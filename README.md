# ULEZ_house_prices
This is the repository containing the code and most recent version of the working paper 'How Does Emissions-Charging Influence House Prices? Evidence From London’s ULEZ'. It subsumes the contents of the repository 'ULEZ_house_prices_WMESP'. Older versions of the working paper are available at https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/wmesp/ and https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/559575.

## Notes on Code
The code folder contains the following files to clean the raw data into a form ready for analysis:

-	‘yearly_price_paid_generation.do’, which is run in Stata to split the raw HM Land Registry data in ‘pp_complete.csv’ up into individual yearly files for each year since 2015 (in the Price Paid Data folder in Temp)
-	‘house_processing.py’, which is run in ArcGIS to take the raw yearly files in csv form, geocode the observations, calculate all the necessary variables for my dissertation, and save the processed yearly files again as csv files (in Temp, as pp_’year’_processed.csv)
-	‘cleaning.do’, which is run in Stata to clean the dataset generated by the above Python script, creating the required variables, and saving it in Temp as ‘pp_ready.dta’

Having obtained the cleaned dataset, the following files in the code folder then analyse it:

-	‘graphics.do’, which gives the code to create various exploratory graphs and tables used within the analysis
-	‘analysis_house_prices.do’, which gives the code to run the various confirmatory regressions and robustness checks used in the analysis
The following Python scripts are also stored in the code folder, to create some geographical figures representing the ULEZ and my zones of analysis
-	‘ulez_expansion_graph.py’, which gives the code (to be run in ArcGIS) and explanation of how to create Figure 1
-	‘analysis_zone_graph.py’, which gives the code (to be run in ArcGIS) and explanation of how to create Figure 2
